# Final Project - VGG16

This repository contains the code for the final project of CS228. The project focuses on implementing and applying the VGG16 convolutional neural network architecture for image classification tasks.

## Code

The code for the project is available in the Jupyter Notebook file named `final_version_vgg16.ipynb`. This notebook provides step-by-step explanations and code snippets for implementing the VGG16 model, training it on a specific dataset, and evaluating its performance.

## Dataset

To run the code successfully, you will need to provide a suitable dataset. The notebook assumes that you have a dataset structured in a specific format, which is explained within the notebook itself. Make sure to modify the relevant sections of the code to point to your dataset and adjust any necessary parameters.

## Requirements

The code in this project has been developed using Python and relies on several libraries and frameworks. Before running the notebook, make sure you have the following dependencies installed:

- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook
- TensorFlow
- Keras
- NumPy
- Matplotlib

You can install these dependencies using `pip` or `conda` by running the following command:

*pip install tensorflow keras numpy matplotlib*


## Usage

To use this code, follow these steps:

1. Clone or download this repository to your local machine.
2. Install the required dependencies as mentioned above.
3. Open the Jupyter Notebook `final_version_vgg16.ipynb` using Jupyter Notebook or any compatible environment.
4. Modify the code as necessary to match your dataset and requirements.
5. Run the notebook cells sequentially to train and evaluate the VGG16 model.

Note: Training a deep learning model may require significant computational resources, so make sure you have access to a suitable GPU or use cloud-based services like Google Colab for accelerated training.

## Credits

This project is based on the CS228 course and makes use of the VGG16 architecture, which was originally proposed by Simonyan and Zisserman. The code and implementation have been developed by [Nityash Gautam].
